# Wiki-viewer

This project was my first experience having data parameters with an API. The documentation for the Wikimedia API was very confusing, and it was a combination of using Stack Overflow, other builds, and the documentation to figure out the way to parse the data before sending it out.

The project is in definite need on an upgrade to the UI in the future, however the main point was to create a usable and navigable Wikipedia viewer that worked both locally and on Codepen.io, as well as being a "mobile" first design.
